# Hi there! 👏👏🏻👏🏼👏🏽👏🏾👏🏿
I am ***Lorenz Liu*** 🙋🏻‍♂️. 

Currently, I'm a master's student in the [**Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC)**](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) program at the Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto. Prior to this, I graduated from [Beihang University, also known as BUAA](http://buaa.edu.cn/) as a ***B.Eng.*** in [Computer Science](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/).

------

My research interests are in the broad area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):

* Reinforcement learning in human-AI interaction
* Interactive technologies in novel digital environments (extended reality, video games, etc.)

My goal is to create intelligent interactive systems that prioritize the needs, capabilities, and perspectives of humans to enhance their overall experience and well-being.

My most interested academic communities: [ACM CHI](https://dl.acm.org/conference/chi), [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/).
