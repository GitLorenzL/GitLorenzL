# Hi there! 👏👏🏻👏🏼👏🏽👏🏾👏🏿
I am ***Zhaoxun Liu*** 🙋🏻‍♂️, you can always call me ***Lorenz*** if this is pronounced more easily.

Currently, I'm a first-year master's student in the [**Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC)**](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) program at the Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto. Prior to this, I graduated from [Beihang University, also known as BUAA](http://buaa.edu.cn/) as a ***B.Eng.*** in [Computer Science](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/).

------

My research interests mainly are:
* Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
* Human-centered AI (HCAI)

I have been pondering how machines can break out of their computational boundaries to understand human intelligence. My goal is to develop computationally efficient deep learning models and algorithms, building the computational foundations to enable computers with the abilities to analyze, recognize and predict subtle human communicative behaviours during social interactions.



## To know more about me… 🤔

My [personal site](https://gitlorenzl.github.io/) and [resume](https://gitlorenzl.github.io/zhaoxun_liu_resume.pdf) are always public. ☑️
