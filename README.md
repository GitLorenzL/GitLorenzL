# Hi there! 👏👏🏻👏🏼👏🏽👏🏾👏🏿
I am ***Lorenz Liu*** 🙋🏻‍♂️. 

Currently, I'm a master's student in the [**Master of Science in Applied Computing (MScAC)**](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) program at the Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto. Prior to this, I graduated from [Beihang University, also known as BUAA](http://buaa.edu.cn/) as a ***B.Eng.*** in [Computer Science](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/).

------

My research interests are in the broad area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):

 - Human-AI Interaction (RLHF, Generative AI, Multimodal, Alignment, etc.)
 - Novel Interactive Technologies (Text Entry, Manipulation, etc. )

My goal is to create intelligent interactive systems that prioritize the needs, capabilities, and safety of humans.

My most interested academic communities: [ACM CHI](https://dl.acm.org/conference/chi), [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/).
